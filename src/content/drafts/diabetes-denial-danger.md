## Diabetes Type 2

> A __chronic__ (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
> Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.
