## Tiny changes, remarkable results 

<ImageQuote src="/articles/atomic-habits.png">
    If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.

    ~ James Clear, Atomic Habits
