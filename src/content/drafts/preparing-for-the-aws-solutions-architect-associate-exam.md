# Daily study

At least 30 mins. Preferably an hour.

## Why I want this certification

it gives me the structure to study
its not enough

## System Design

Some books I am reading

I am complimenting this with systems design, use cases like 

- Netflix

simpler systems
distributed systems
making better system design decisions

my experience with aws so far
- serverless applications
- lambda

exam prep notes
Whizlabs video tutorials and labs
why I prefer reading notes and documentation

Practicing with the Aws console
practicing with the aws cli commands


## AWS Well Architected Framework

## Yikes, this primer is dense

Found a systems design primer on Github

practice tests
